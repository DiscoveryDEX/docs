# Futures Markets

Futures and options are complementary products and can work together to bring the DiscoveryDEX consensus price to tradable reality using tokenized assets. Note that DiscoveryDEX could be used to price non-tokenized assets as well, but for non-tokenized assets, similar futures markets would have to be built off-chain, or built into escrow arrangements to settle OTC trades.

What this means to the DeFi ecosystem is an additional pool of liquidity available for trading tokenized assets. As will be shown below, bridged tokens of the same denomination but originating from different chains will be able to take advantage of the same DiscoveryDEX consensus price even though they are distinct tokens. This is possible because on the DiscoveryDEX system price discovery is decoupled from trade activity through the consensus price markets.

The consensus average, hedged with options trades, leading a consensus price for separate token futures markets is what is meant by “decoupling price discovery from trading”.
