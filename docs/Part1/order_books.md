# Order Books

In traditional financial markets the term price discovery means passively observing prices that result from order book trading activity. The conventional exchange order book can be viewed as a centralized price consensus mechanism that depends on the concentration of order flow into a single matching engine both geographically and temporally, to ensure trades execute at the best bid or ask.

The accuracy of prices generated from an order book is dependent on the volume of trading activity and as such can be sensitive to short term imbalances in supply and demand. As an example, at times during a price runup or selloff the best bid or ask on an order book does not necessarily reflect an accurate consensus price, hence the tendency for order books to mean revert after the short-term supply / demand imbalance corrects. Here we use the term “consensus price” to refer to a price that a majority of active participants AND passive “hodlers” and observers would converge to. During a runup or selloff a minority of active participants can create a price that will eventually correct.
