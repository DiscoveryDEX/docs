# Intro

The term, “price discovery”, is a very broad term. When used in the realm of traditional financial markets, the term is generally used to refer to the passive act of observing prices that trades occur at. There are usually three assumptions behind this type of passive price observation:

1. There is enough trade liquidity for efficient markets to generate an accurate price.
2. The price is observed in real-time. For example, 15-minute delayed prices may no longer be accurate for price discovery in a volatile market.
3. Participants in the observed markets act in real-time to correct short-term trade imbalances.
