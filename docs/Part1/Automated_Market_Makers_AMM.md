# Automated Market Makers (AMM)

Automated market makers improve on the order book as a decentralized trading mechanism by adding market maker functionality into on-chain smart contract logic, substituting a bonding curve to approximate a theoretically natural supply / demand pricing curve. The result is a trading engine well adapted to blockchain technology but as a price consensus mechanism it is still highly sensitive to short term imbalances in supply and demand, just like the order book is. In fact, the AMM relies almost entirely on short-term price volatility for its price discovery since there are no fixed bids or asks like on an order book.
